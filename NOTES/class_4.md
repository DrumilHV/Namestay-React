# Building APP

1. Always plan the app first and then start coding. Its always easier to build the app when the design are ready .
2. Passing props to component is same as passing argument to a function.
3. When we pass data to component is called passing the props.
4. We can pass dynamic data to our app.
5. We can destructure ourselves `const {name, age} = props` or javascript can help us destructure on the fly(destructure in the function's `()`) `function({name, age})`.
6. **_Config Driven UI_** : Controlling the UI using the data we get. <br>
   eg. Dehli may have a different offers for food than Chennai, but we use the same UI in both cases, the UI changes according to the data we get. All the UI is driven by a config.
