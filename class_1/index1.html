  <!-- we use React for core features of react , like creating elements . react also works with moblies , and is a cross platform 
    development tool , so react cdn/ react has core features of react.  -->

  <!-- IMPORTANT!! : 
    REACT DEV cdn : better for debugging,
    will have source maps (A file that maps transformed code to actual code ),
    degubgger tools are attached                                             ,
    devtools profile is attached                                             ,
    Hot Module Replacement 
      (Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running,
      without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:
      •  Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.
      •  Save valuable development time by only updating what's changed.
      •  Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS in the source code,
         which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser's dev tools.
      )

    REACT PROD cdn: will optimize ,
     • compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code (and var names included) ,
     • Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.

  Crossorigin in script tag
  Element	Restrictions
  img, audio, video : 	When resource is placed in <canvas>, element is marked as tainted.

  link	            : Request with no appropriate crossorigin header may be discarded.
  

  The crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute.

  These attributes are enumerated, and have the following possible values:

  anonymous       :   Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to 'same-origin'. There is no exchange of user credentials via cookies, client-side TLS certificates or HTTP authentication, unless destination is the same origin.
  <script src="https://example.com/example-framework.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  

  use-credentials : Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to 'include' and user credentials are always included.
  <link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest" crossorigin="use-credentials" />

  ""             : Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like crossorigin or crossorigin="", is the same as anonymous.
  An invalid keyword and an empty string will be handled as the anonymous keyword.
